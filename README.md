# Avalanche Subnet Creation

## Overview

This project sets up a new network on the Avalanche platform called "gamersSubnet," with its own digital token called GamersTokens (DKGV). This network works with MetaMask and allows you to create and use smart contracts using Remix.

## Project Features

This project involves working with two types of smart contracts: an ERC20 token and a vault contract. These contracts can:

- Create a new digital token with your chosen details like name and symbol.
- Easily send and receive tokens following standard rules.
- Increase the total number of tokens available.
- Reduce the total number of tokens available.
